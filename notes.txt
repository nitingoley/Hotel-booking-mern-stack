Code Breakdown:
useMutation Hook:

The useMutation hook is typically used for handling operations that modify data (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE requests). It is part of the react-query library, which helps with data fetching and state management in React applications.
Syntax: const mutation = useMutation(mutationFunction, { options });
ApiClient.register:

ApiClient.register refers to a function that handles the API request for registering a user. This function would send a request to the server (for example, a POST request to register a new user).
In the context of your application, ApiClient.register should be a function that wraps the logic for making the registration request to the backend API.
Options Passed to useMutation: The second argument passed to useMutation is an object containing various lifecycle hooks (onSuccess, onError, etc.) that react to the state of the mutation:

onSuccess:
This is a callback function that will be triggered if the mutation (API call) is successful.
In this case, when the registration request is successful, it logs "Register Successfully!" to the console.
onError:
This is a callback function that will be triggered if the mutation (API call) fails.
In this case, when the registration request fails, the error is logged to the console.
How useMutation Works:

When mutation.mutate() is called (typically in response to a user action, such as form submission), it will trigger the API call.
After the API call, based on whether it succeeded or failed, the appropriate callback (onSuccess or onError) will be invoked.





Code Explanation
Pagination Setup:

pageSize = 5: Specifies the number of hotel entries to be returned per page (in this case, 5).
req.query.page: Retrieves the page number from the request query parameters (e.g., /search?page=2).
pageNumber: Parses the page query parameter and defaults to page 1 if no parameter is provided.
skip: Calculates how many entries to skip for the current page using the formula:
skip
=
(
pageNumber
−
1
)
×
pageSize
skip=(pageNumber−1)×pageSize
Database Queries:

Hotel.find().skip(skip).limit(pageSize):
Retrieves a subset of hotels from the database.
skip(skip): Skips over the entries from earlier pages.
limit(pageSize): Restricts the number of returned entries to pageSize.
Hotel.countDocuments(): Fetches the total number of hotel documents in the collection, which is used to calculate the total pages.
Response Formatting:




=
⌈
total
/
pageSize
⌉
pages=⌈total/pageSize⌉
Error Handling:

If an error occurs (e.g., database issues), a 500 status code is returned with an error message.
The error is also logged to the console for debugging.
Response:

The final JSON response includes the list of hotels for the requested page and pagination details.
Example Behavior
If there are 12 hotels in the database and the client requests page 2 (/search?page=2):

skip = (2 - 1) * 5 = 5 (skips the first 5 entries).
limit = 5 (fetches the next 5 entries).
Response:
json
