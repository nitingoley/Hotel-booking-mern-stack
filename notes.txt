Code Breakdown:
useMutation Hook:

The useMutation hook is typically used for handling operations that modify data (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE requests). It is part of the react-query library, which helps with data fetching and state management in React applications.
Syntax: const mutation = useMutation(mutationFunction, { options });
ApiClient.register:

ApiClient.register refers to a function that handles the API request for registering a user. This function would send a request to the server (for example, a POST request to register a new user).
In the context of your application, ApiClient.register should be a function that wraps the logic for making the registration request to the backend API.
Options Passed to useMutation: The second argument passed to useMutation is an object containing various lifecycle hooks (onSuccess, onError, etc.) that react to the state of the mutation:

onSuccess:
This is a callback function that will be triggered if the mutation (API call) is successful.
In this case, when the registration request is successful, it logs "Register Successfully!" to the console.
onError:
This is a callback function that will be triggered if the mutation (API call) fails.
In this case, when the registration request fails, the error is logged to the console.
How useMutation Works:

When mutation.mutate() is called (typically in response to a user action, such as form submission), it will trigger the API call.
After the API call, based on whether it succeeded or failed, the appropriate callback (onSuccess or onError) will be invoked.





Code Explanation
Pagination Setup:

pageSize = 5: Specifies the number of hotel entries to be returned per page (in this case, 5).
req.query.page: Retrieves the page number from the request query parameters (e.g., /search?page=2).
pageNumber: Parses the page query parameter and defaults to page 1 if no parameter is provided.
skip: Calculates how many entries to skip for the current page using the formula:
skip
=
(
pageNumber
−
1
)
×
pageSize
skip=(pageNumber−1)×pageSize
Database Queries:

Hotel.find().skip(skip).limit(pageSize):
Retrieves a subset of hotels from the database.
skip(skip): Skips over the entries from earlier pages.
limit(pageSize): Restricts the number of returned entries to pageSize.
Hotel.countDocuments(): Fetches the total number of hotel documents in the collection, which is used to calculate the total pages.
Response Formatting:




=
⌈
total
/
pageSize
⌉
pages=⌈total/pageSize⌉
Error Handling:

If an error occurs (e.g., database issues), a 500 status code is returned with an error message.
The error is also logged to the console for debugging.
Response:

The final JSON response includes the list of hotels for the requested page and pagination details.
Example Behavior
If there are 12 hotels in the database and the client requests page 2 (/search?page=2):

skip = (2 - 1) * 5 = 5 (skips the first 5 entries).
limit = 5 (fetches the next 5 entries).
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "data": [...], // 5 hotel objects
  "pagination": {
    "total": 12,
    "pages": 3
  }
}




                   *** Sorting approach *** 



                   1. The Purpose of constructSearchQuery
The function:

Takes a queryParams object containing search filters like destination, adultCount, childCount, etc.
Dynamically builds a query object (constructedQuery) that MongoDB can use to filter data from a collection (e.g., hotels).
This approach makes the search feature flexible. If a user provides a filter, it’s added to the query. If not, it’s skipped.

2. The Parameters and Their Handling
ts
Copy code
interface QueryParams {
  destination?: string;
  adultCount?: string | number;
  childCount?: string | number;
  facilities?: string | string[];
  types?: string | string[];
  stars?: string | string[];
  maxPrice?: string | number;
}
The QueryParams interface defines the expected structure of the incoming queryParams. Each property is optional (?) since users might not specify all filters.

For example:

destination: Where the user wants to go.
adultCount: Number of adults required.
facilities: Desired amenities like "pool" or "wifi."
3. Constructing the Query
a. Destination Filter:
ts
Copy code
if (queryParams.destination) {
  constructedQuery.$or = [
    { city: new RegExp(queryParams.destination, "i") },
    { country: new RegExp(queryParams.destination, "i") },
  ];
}
What it does: Searches hotels where the city or country matches the destination string, ignoring case ("i" flag).
Why RegExp? To allow partial and case-insensitive matching. For example, searching for "ind" will match "India" or "Indiana."
b. Adult and Child Count:
ts
Copy code
if (queryParams.adultCount) {
  constructedQuery.adultCount = { $gte: parseInt(queryParams.adultCount.toString()) };
}

if (queryParams.childCount) {
  constructedQuery.childCount = { $gte: parseInt(queryParams.childCount.toString()) };
}
What it does: Ensures the hotel can accommodate at least the specified number of adults or children.
Why $gte? $gte means "greater than or equal to." If a user asks for adultCount=2, the query will find hotels with at least 2 adults.
c. Facilities Filter:
ts
Copy code
if (queryParams.facilities) {
  constructedQuery.facilities = {
    $all: Array.isArray(queryParams.facilities)
      ? queryParams.facilities
      : [queryParams.facilities],
  };
}
What it does: Filters hotels that have all the requested facilities (e.g., pool, gym, free parking).
Why $all? MongoDB ensures the hotel has all the requested facilities when $all is used.
d. Types Filter:
ts
Copy code
if (queryParams.types) {
  constructedQuery.type = {
    $in: Array.isArray(queryParams.types) ? queryParams.types : [queryParams.types],
  };
}
What it does: Filters hotels that match one or more of the specified types (e.g., "luxury," "budget").
Why $in? $in checks if the type field matches any of the values in the array.
e. Star Rating Filter:
ts
Copy code
if (queryParams.stars) {
  const starRatings = Array.isArray(queryParams.stars)
    ? queryParams.stars.map((star: string) => parseInt(star))
    : parseInt(queryParams.stars);

  constructedQuery.starRating = { $in: starRatings };
}
What it does: Filters hotels with specific star ratings (e.g., 3, 4, or 5 stars).
Why Array Handling? If the user provides multiple star ratings, we map each one to a number.
f. Price Filter:
ts
Copy code
if (queryParams.maxPrice) {
  constructedQuery.pricePerNight = {
    $lte: parseInt(queryParams.maxPrice.toString()),
  };
}
What it does: Ensures the price per night is less than or equal to the specified maximum.
Why $lte? $lte means "less than or equal to," which limits results to affordable hotels.
4. Final Query
The constructed query combines all the filters:

ts
Copy code
return constructedQuery;
If queryParams contains:

json
Copy code
{
  "destination": "paris",
  "adultCount": "2",
  "maxPrice": "150"
}
The query becomes:

json
Copy code
{
  "$or": [
    { "city": /paris/i },
    { "country": /paris/i }
  ],
  "adultCount": { "$gte": 2 },
  "pricePerNight": { "$lte": 150 }
}
5. Why Use This Approach?
Dynamic Filtering: The query adjusts based on which parameters the user provides.
Scalability: New filters can be added easily.
Optimized for MongoDB: Operators like $or, $gte, and $all ensure efficient querying.
